Medical Records for the Mobile Generation


  What is it?
  -----------
  
This project is the user application part of the MediReQ Project. This project was selected as top ten idea in the Qualcomm Intern IdeaQuest Contest. The MediReQ project consists of two Android applications, MediReQ-User and MediReQ-Reader, and a web application, MediReQ-Web (not posted). These three components work together to enables patients to check in at the doctor's office as they arrive and it gives doctors an easy way to browse through a patientâ€™s medical files for relevant information before a check up. MediReQ displays all information in a easy-to-read visual layout that facilitates more efficient processing, which reduces the total time required for a simple check-up or even a longer consultation. 

MediReQ-Reader has been programmed to take the data from the MediReQ application and send it to MediReQ-Web for the hospital to view using near field communication (NFC). MediReQ-Reader is an example of how to program an Android phone to act as an NFC reader and an example of how to use NFC for something other than payments.
